## yawnoc

Yawnoc is an experimental puzzle game I've developed based
on Conway's Game of Life. Green cells are collectible,
red cells are obstacles, white cells are living. The player's
objective is to collect every green cell by placing different
cells on the board and having them interact with each other.
