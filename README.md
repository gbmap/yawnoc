# YAWNOC

Yawnoc (which is Conway backwards) is an experimental puzzle game. The player's objective is to collect all green cells in the board
using the resources he is provided with at the beginning of each level. White cells behave just as the classic Game of Life, while
red cells are static and never destroyed.
